# Note Harbor

Sticky Notes for Chrome, 
Whenever You Need Them

## About

A common pain point people experience during research is clutter. Whether it’s for schoolwork or professional projects, it's easy to find yourself jumping between a crapload of tabs. Our team designed Note Harbor to simplify situations like this. 

Our extension pops out of the side of your browser whenever you need it. Store whatever text you find or whatever ideas you come up with — all saved locally on your own computer. No analytics, no network requests.

Also, [we're on Chrome Web Store!!!](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/note-harbor/lphcgennjjaecdllfmkbfdemmdabcoel?authuser=0&hl=en)

### How to Use

1. To open Note Harbor's side panel, press keyboard shorcut *ctrl-shift-L*.
2. Write whatever you want! Compose stickies either by creating notes directly in the side panel or by right-clicking highlighted text.

**Warning:** clearing your browser's cache will delete all stored note data.
