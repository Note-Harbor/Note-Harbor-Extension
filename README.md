## About

A common pain point I experience during research is clutter. Whether it’s for my internship or my schoolwork, I always find myself jumping between a crapload of tabs. My team and I designed Note Harbor to simplify situations like this. 

Our extension pops out of the side of your browser whenever you need it. Store whatever text you find or whatever ideas you come up with — all saved privately on your own computer.

**Warning:** clearing your browser's cache will delete all stored note data.

## Installation

To get Note Harbor on your browser, visit us at the Chrome Web Store [future link].

You can also install Note Harbor with the following instructions:

2. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file (titled `Note-Harbor-Extension`)
   * *Warning*: deleting the unzipped files will disable Note Harbor
4. In Chrome, go to the extensions management page (chrome://extensions)
5. Turn on Developer Mode (top right of screen)
6. Drag the Note-Harbor-Extension folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards)
