## About

A common pain point I experience during research is clutter. Whether it’s for my internship or my schoolwork, I always find myself jumping between a crapload of tabs. We designed Note Harbor to simplify situations like this. 

Our extension pops out of the side of your browser whenever you need it. Store whatever text you find or whatever ideas you come up with — all saved privately on your own computer.

### How to Use

1. To open Note Harbor's side panel, press keyboard shorcut *ctrl-shift-L*.
2. Write whatever you want! Compose stickies either by creating notes directly in the side panel or by right-clicking highlighted text.

**Warning:** clearing your browser's cache will delete all stored note data.

## Installation

Use these instructions to get Note Harbor on your browser:

1. Download/Clone our repo as a ZIP file
2. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file (titled `Note-Harbor-Extension`)
   * *Warning*: deleting the unzipped files will disable Note Harbor
4. In Chrome, go to the extensions management page (chrome://extensions)
5. Turn on Developer Mode (top right of screen)
6. Drag the Note-Harbor-Extension folder anywhere on the page to import it
